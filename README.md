<h2>Background<h2><br>
<div style="font-weight:lighter"><p>The data was collected in between 2015 and 2017 from a city hotel and a resort hotel both located in Porttugal however different cities. So we can assume that the varibles for both hotles are independent. And the value of this data set is for conducting researchs on different factors that affect the hotel booking and booking cancellation. Especially to have a clear picture of what the most important factors are having respective impacts on city hotel and resort's booking cancellation rate.<p></div><br>

<h2>Target<h2><br>
<div style="font-weight:lighter"><p>EDA and booking cancellation prediction are formed two main parts of this data analysis report. Based on database, we will not only horizontally measure the correlation of different features, but also vertially compare different effects of varibles on city hotel and resort hotel.</p>

<p>We will specifically look at the distribution of some important features such as the market segments, customer_type, avreage daily room rate per person etc. As hotel and resort bookings are very seasonal, booking rate can be fluctuated,so another analysis precedure is to discover the peak month for each hotel and its booking rate and adr.</p>

<p>Second part of this report is to train decision tree, knn and logsticClassifier models based on provided database, and see which model will perform better om predicting booking cancellation rate.</p></div>
